# Shooting Rocket

This is a simple action game (still under development) written in asynchronus Python using the `ncurses` library, which creates a pseudo-graphical interface.

## Gameplay

You control a spaceship rocket and shoot space garbage accumulated on the orbit.

Presently you can only control the rocket with a keyboard, but the shooting function has not yet been implemented, neither is the orbit garbage. But all this is coming soon!
